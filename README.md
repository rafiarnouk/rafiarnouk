## Hello 👋

I’m Rafi, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia with plans to minor in Mathematics. 

I have recently spent 8 months building internal laboratory management software used by scientists and engineers developing electrochromic windows at Miru Smart Technologies. Before that, I spent a summer working with the data team at SkyHive where I contributed to data analysis projects involving large-scale labour economy data.

I am currently working on a [machine learning project](https://github.com/rafiarnouk/nba-ml-analysis) involving NBA data. The goal is to explore how I can use various different machine learning models and techniques to make predictions and gain insights from basketball data scraped from [Basketball Reference](basketball-reference.com) and social media.

<!--
I am passionate about the field of machine learning and its potential to positively impact all corners of our lives. I am taking various steps to expand my experience in the area, including minoring in mathematics and working on a personal project involving the development of machine learning models based on NBA statistics. 

Outside of machine learning and full stack software development, I am interested in topics including discrete math, logic, sports analytics, and more.
