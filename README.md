## Hello 👋

I’m Rafi, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia. 

🌱 I have recently completed an internship at Amazon in Vancouver, where I was working on the LLM Runtime and Guardrails Team in the Alexa organization. Before that, I spent 8 months building internal laboratory management software used by scientists and engineers developing electrochromic windows at Miru Smart Technologies. Additionally, I have spent a summer working with the data team at SkyHive where I contributed to data analysis projects involving large-scale labour economy data.

🏀 I am currently working on a [machine learning project](https://github.com/rafiarnouk/nba-ml-analysis) involving NBA data. The goal is to explore how I can use various different machine learning models and techniques to make predictions and gain insights from basketball data scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and perhaps social media. At the moment I am working on the machine learning aspect of the project in a Colab notebook, but in the future I intend to turn this into a full stack web application where users can explore the results of the project.

<!--
I am passionate about the field of machine learning and its potential to positively impact all corners of our lives. I am taking various steps to expand my experience in the area, including minoring in mathematics and working on a personal project involving the development of machine learning models based on NBA statistics. 

Outside of machine learning and full stack software development, I am interested in topics including discrete math, logic, sports analytics, and more.
